01- ssh intro.
    - Need to remote manage and use remote servers with ease and security.
    - Secure shell was started in 1995 and provides strong authentication,
      confidentiality and availability.
    - Run in every server known to mankind.
    - But.. but... MS Windows.
    - Openssh server and client is te most popular implementation, 
      but there are others, most notably clients: putty, SecureCRT, etcs.
    - IETF has build many RFCs for ssh protocol and standarized its methods
      ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#Standards_documentation )

01.1 why? telnet vs ssh
    - telnet is from 1969, and lacks many features. We should always avoid it.
    - ssh is extremely simple but provides many features.
    - It is not a tool but more akin of a tool box.
    - At this point we should all be using SSH-2, although there is backwards
      compatibility for old, venerable SSH-1 that we should promptly disable.
