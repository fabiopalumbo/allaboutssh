05- Goodies.
05.1 Keychain and other ssh-agent managers.
https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain

It checks if there is a running ssh-agent, or starts it and set environment
variables accordingly so ssh is able to get keys from ssh-agent.
Just add to your .bashrc:
sjmuniz@tardis:~$ grep keychain .bashrc 
#add keychain
eval $(/usr/bin/keychain --eval)

05.2 putty suite (puttygen, pageant, configure putty options)

It is windows, and I refuse to base64 encode images here.
